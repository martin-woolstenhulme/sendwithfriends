Presentation Outline

Intro:
SnapCash Exchange will transfer money over a network of friends to avoid bank waiting periods or federal reporting rules. 

For example you would have to pay income taxes on deposits over $14k and there would be a waiting period on amounts over $2500.

SnapCash will split the originator's amount amongst your friends to transfer into the end users account. 

for example: $10k from user A to User B, 
	SnapCash will select the friends to receive the money from User A, 
	then those friends will send the funds to User B

The funds are transferred using MasterCard and/or Paypal for confirmation.

SnapCash will send an SMS message using the Twilio API to alert each user.

Hosted on DigitalOcean using Python Flask and MySql.
